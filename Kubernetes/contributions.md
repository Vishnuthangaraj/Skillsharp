			Initially, in applications migrated from one env to another env (dev-test-prd), We have to check a lot of dependencies for the application to work in the new  environment as previous  environment, So the concept of containerization comes into picture, your application (all dependencies, packages, code) will be taken as an image and this imagebe used in the required environments, thus making the application to work without any dependency failure.
